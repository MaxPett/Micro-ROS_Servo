# Micro-ROS_Servo

This repository contains a guide and code for a project that utilizes Micro ROS Foxy, ESP32, FreeRTOS, and a PCA9685 board to control multiple servos attached to a PWM/Servo Driver board. The project has been tested on a Linux Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS environment. The guide walks through the installation of ROS2, the setup of a Micro-ROS workspace, and the establishment of communication between Micro-ROS and ROS2 using a custom message format called "ServoMessage". Additionally, the guide covers the implementation of third-party libraries and the usage of two different RTOS systems. The code includes examples of how to use the Micro ROS Foxy framework to send and receive ServoMessages over the network, allowing for precise control of the attached servos. If you are interested in building projects that involve robotics or servo control, this repository could be a great resource to get started.
